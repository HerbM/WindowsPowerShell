LINQPad Succinctly offers IT professionals a detailed examination of how and why LINQPad can improve development lifecycle and deliver applications in less time. Author Jos√© Roberto Olivas Mendoza begins with a detailed overview of LINQPad's features, then delves into the installation process, including necessary prerequisites. Readers then get instruction on how to get the most out of LINQPad, such as how to query data bases and using LINQPad as a code scratchpad, which allows users to save significant time and effort on application delivery.

High Performance PowerShell with LINQ - Simple Talk
PowerShell is a scripting language, and like all scripting languages it struggles to perform well with rapid iterative processes such as aggregation. It isn't well-known that PowerShell can use LINQ for many of those tasks which would otherwise use iteration, though somewhat awkwardly. However, some of the speed improvements you can get are startling. To get you well started, Michael explains every LINQ function , gives you example code in C#, The PowerShell way of getting the result, and finally Powershell's use of LINQ. This article could change the way you use PowerShell.
